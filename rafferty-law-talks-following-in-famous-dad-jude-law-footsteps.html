Me and Dad would go on an adventure around the park and play make-believe. It feels like that now, but it's moved forward a few years."</p><p id=e_-RqfNuCFx data-wc=103>Indeed, Raff has come a long way since acting out fairy tales in the park. His latest role, in Steven Spielberg's and Tom Hanks's Second World War drama, sees him playing Master Sergeant Ken Lemmons alongside a stellar cast including Elvis star Austin Butler, Saltburn actor Barry Keoghan and Dua Lipa's new boyfriend, Callum Turner. Raff was "honoured" to tell the true story of the 19-year-old flight chief who was part of the 100th Bomb Group, charged with taking out enemy targets in Germany, and has already won praise from the Lemmons family, who helped him prepare for the role of their ancestor.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: The trailer for Apple TV+'s Masters of the Air</figure><p id=eazK6XvAdWA data-wc=41>"Performing on stage and acting is something that I'm passionate about," says Raff, who showed his dedication to the part by spending an extra hour and a half in make-up each day to cover his 30-plus tattoos before the cameras rolled.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Masters of the Air filming locations: where was Apple TV+'s World War 2 epic filmed?" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/6b7475264837-masters-of-the-air.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Masters of the Air filming locations: where was Apple TV+'s World War 2 epic filmed?" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Masters of the Air filming locations: where was Apple TV+'s World War 2 epic filmed?</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Masters of the Air's Jon Ewart reveals Tom Hank's 'big' gesture that helped cast on set of Apple TV+ drama - Exclusive" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/4d589a8bb03b-jon-ewart-tom-hanks.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Masters of the Air's Jon Ewart reveals Tom Hank's 'big' gesture that helped cast on set of Apple TV+ drama - Exclusive" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Masters of the Air's Jon Ewart reveals Tom Hank's 'big' gesture that helped cast on set of Apple TV+ drama - Exclusive</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Who is Jude Law's wife?

"I had a crazy year of getting so many; my mum has said I'm banned from getting any more. But I don't regret them. I've got silly ones like a jelly baby and loads of random ones."</p><p id=ebbjaRK1bx8 data-wc=58>His passion for acting, he says, stems from his love of learning new things and taking on new character traits. "For Masters of the Air, I learnt to, I learnt to play 1940s blues harmonica. It's amazing to learn real stories from the past and retell these legacies. I feel really honoured to be playing Master Sergeant Ken."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/91edc669c5fa-rafferty-law.jpg><p id=est0HHC1pe data-wc=49>There are, of course, "positives and hindrances" in being born into a famous family, particularly when following in your parents' footsteps.

"Like a lot of people in their late teens, I made mistakes and learnt lessons. You have to put in the hours and the work â€“ it doesn't matter who you know.</p><p id=e-vZICcwAGJ data-wc=69>"Doing Twist [the Sky drama he filmed alongside acting legend Sir Michael Caine] was an eye-opener; having to get up at 5am for long shoots and watching people get there and give their fullest," he says. "I fell in love with exercise during that shoot because I had to train," he continues, referring to the parkour required for his scenes. "I took that energy and held on to it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/44d2f8985265-rafferty-law-sadie-frost.jpg><p id=eS24vQa8WaQ data-wc=42>Exercise has become central to his wellbeing, along with breathing techniques tipped by the extreme athlete Wim Hof.
