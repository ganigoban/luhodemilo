The actor recently explained that he went “method” for his latest role, retaining the accent of his character Oliver Quick and staying “in the clothes he wears”.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Murphy (seen here on the right with Matt Damon) has been nominated for his leading role as the eponymous scientist in Oppenheimer</span></figure><p>They are up against Bradley Cooper, nominated for his turn as conductor Leonard Bernstein in Maestro, Leonardo DiCaprio for his performance as a greedy war veteran in Killers of the Flower Moon, and Colman Domingo as Bayard Rustin, an adviser to Martin Luther King Jr in Rustin.</p><p>Keoghan’s English co-star Rosamund Pike has earned a best actress in a drama nomination for her part in the black comedy, but fellow Britons have not fared as well as previous years.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Keoghan said he went all 'method' for his role in Saltburn</span></figure><p>This year has seen the fewest Britons nominated for film acting awards since 2011.

Gary Oldman was recognised for his performance in the spy thriller Slow Horses, while Helen Mirren earned a best television actress nod for the Western drama 1923.</p><p>The Crown fared well, with Dominic West nominated for his portrayal of Prince Charles, as well as Imelda Staunton, who played Queen Elizabeth II.</p><p>West recently revealed that he was struggling to rid himself of the mannerisms he had copied from Charles, saying: “It’s a very hard part to shake off. I found myself doing it the other day, fiddling with my ring finger, and all the little things he does, and the way he points.”</p><p>The Crown, which will air its final episodes on Netflix this week, helped the streaming platform garner 13 nominations.</p><p>Warner Bros scored 35 thanks to the hit release Barbie, which became the highest-grossing film of 2023. The comedy starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling has earned nine nominations, including those for best picture, best director for Greta Gerwig, and best actress and best supporting actor for Robbie and Gosling, respectively.</p><p>Barbie will go head-to-head against its rival Oppenheimer for several awards, including best director for Christopher Nolan, after the <a class=ck-custom-link href=#>“Barbenheimer” </a>effect gave cinemas across the world a boost over the summer.</p><p>Winners in the 81st edition of the awards will be announced on January 7, live from a ceremony at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwfo9ramhpYmR%2BcnvGqKOdnZ5itK27wZ6qZpmemb%2Bmw4ysmqispGKwqrjLopinZZ2qv7G02GaZmqqirnqssc6gn5qmXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgolden-globes-andrew-scott-cillian-murphy-barry-keoghan.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgolden-globes-andrew-scott-cillian-murphy-barry-keoghan.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgolden-globes-andrew-scott-cillian-murphy-barry-keoghan.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgolden-globes-andrew-scott-cillian-murphy-barry-keoghan.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgolden-globes-andrew-scott-cillian-murphy-barry-keoghan.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgolden-globes-andrew-scott-cillian-murphy-barry-keoghan.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./is-there-crime-on-marthas-vineyard.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./is-there-crime-on-marthas-vineyard.html>Is there crime on Martha's Vineyard?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ian-mackaye-net-worth-56620.html>Ian MacKaye Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ian-mackaye-net-worth-56620.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
