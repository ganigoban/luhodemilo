He then wrote his first Broadway musical titled&nbsp;</span><span>Shinbone Alley.&nbsp;</span><span>In the late 1950s, Mel Brooks teamed up with former co-writer Carl Reiner to develop their own show.&nbsp;</span><span>2000 year old man.&nbsp;</span><span>It became a cult hit in New York.&nbsp;Mel Brooks and Reiner expanded the show and it quickly caught on in Hollywood and became a mainstay on&nbsp;</span><span>The Steve Allen Show.</span></p><p>During the 1960s, Brooks wrote it into his musical compositions, animated shorts, and television series.&nbsp;For his writing on&nbsp;<span>All Americans, The Critic,</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Get Smart,</span><span>&nbsp;he won two Tony Awards, an Oscar & & Emmy Awards.</span></p><p><span>In 1968, Mel made his directorial debut with the film&nbsp;</span><span>The Producers.&nbsp;</span><span>The film was a huge success, winning an Oscar and then 12 Tonys for its musical adaptation.&nbsp;Four years later, the director and screenwriter signed a contract with Warner Brothers to rewrite the screenplay for&nbsp;</span><span>Selles Blazing.&nbsp;</span><span>By the end of the year, the film had recorded the industry’s second-highest gross for that year.</span></p><p><span>In 1974 he directed&nbsp;</span><span>Young Frankenstein</span><span>&nbsp;and had actors like Gene Wilder, Peter Boyle, and Marty Feldman on set.&nbsp;The film was nominated for 2 Oscars and was the third highest grosser of the year.&nbsp;During the 1970s, he continued to write and direct for different projects such as&nbsp;</span><span>When Things Were Rotten, Silent Film,</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>High Anxiety.</span></p><p>For someone who was known as a comedian to many in his career at that time, Mel Brooks took the unexpected route when he started Brooksfilms, a production company dedicated to developing non-comedy content.&nbsp;Under Brooksfilms he produced&nbsp;<span>The Elephant Man, History of the World Part I,</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>To Be or Not To Be.&nbsp;</span><span>For the latter, he also played the role of Hitler.</span></p><p><span>In the 1990s, Mel Brooks worked on projects such as&nbsp;</span><span>Life Stinks, Robin Hood: Men in Tights,</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Dracula: Dead and In Love,</span><span>&nbsp;all direction efforts.</span></p><p><span>In the 2000s, he started appearing on TV like&nbsp;</span><span>Mad About You, The Simpsons, Comedians in the Car Get Coffee,</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Curb Your Enthusiasm.&nbsp;</span><span>More recently, he has done numerous dubbing or animation projects such as&nbsp;</span><span>Dora the Explorer, Mr. Peabody & Sherman, The Guardian Brothers, Toy Story 4,</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>The Hotel Transylvania</span><span>&nbsp;franchise.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Mel Brooks’ family: wife and son</span></strong></h2><p><span>On the family front, Mel has been married twice, with both unions producing a total of four children.&nbsp;He was first married to Florence Baum in 1953.

active career, theactor-producer-director appeared in more than 150 projects.&nbsp;In recent history, however, he hasn’t been as visible on screen as you would expect of someone in the later years of

his last directed work was&nbsp;</span><span>Dracula: Dead and in Love</span><span>&nbsp;in 1995, he announced his last production, a film called&nbsp;</span><span>Blazing Samurai (</span><span>&nbsp;2021).</span></p><h2><strong><span>What is his size?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Mel Brook’s huge career success is not reflected in his physical build.&nbsp;The movie veteran remembers being bullied by other boys while at school because of his short stature.&nbsp;The bullying was part of the reason he transferred to another high school.&nbsp;Fortunately, that didn’t stop him from having a magnificent career.</span></p><p><span>Brooks stands at a height of 5 feet 5 inches which is 165cm.</span></p><h2><strong><span>What is his net worth?</span></strong></h2><p>Mel
