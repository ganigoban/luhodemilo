Produced by Leonard Stern and cowritten by Chris Hayward and Allan Burns, it also starred Jack <a href=#>Cassidy</a> as an egomaniacal actor, Kenneth Mars, and <a href=#>Hamilton Camp</a>. That same year saw Tochi appearing in "And the Children Shall Lead", a third-season episode of <i>Star Trek: The Original Series</i>. Other roles followed, including guest appearances on such popular shows as <i>The Brady Bunch</i>, <i>The Partridge Family</i> and <i>Adam-12</i>.</p><span>1970</span><p>During the mid-1970s, Tochi spent time in the theatre, this time reprising his role as Crown <a href=#>Prince</a> Chulalongkorn in the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera's revival of the musical <i>The King and I</i> at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. There he co-starred with actor Ricardo MontalbÃ¡n, as the King of Siam, to which they would later accompany the show as it went on tour. When the show ended its run, the two remained dear to one another, with Tochi and MontalbÃ¡n rendezvousing regularly for lunch during the run of <i>Fantasy Island</i>.</p><span>1977</span><p>Tochi returned to star in another TV series <i>Space Academy</i> (1977â€“1979) with veteran actor Jonathan Harris (best remembered as Dr. Smith from <i>Lost in Space</i>). His character, Tee Gar Soom, had super-strength and continued the martial arts traditions of his Asian ancestors. During hiatus of the show, Tochi was asked to shoot a 20-minute promotional "behind-the-scenes" visit to the Space Academy for a popular daytime series, <i>Razzmatazz</i>, on CBS. Razzmatazz was a highly regarded news magazine show produced by Don Hewitt and the same production team as CBS's primetime news show, <i>60 Minutes</i>. It starred Barry Bostwick, who opted to leave the show for a career in features, to capitalize on his recently released cult classic <i>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</i>. Searching for a new host, the television network persuaded Tochi to accept their offer of his own daytime show, which aired on the network for 4 more years into the early 1980s.</p><span>1985</span><p>Tochi's debut as a series regular was as Yul Brynner's oldest son and heir Crown <a href=#>Prince</a> Chulalongkorn in <i>Anna and the King</i> on CBS. It was based on the film version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's <i>The King and I</i> and also starred Samantha Eggar and Keye Luke. Although the series was short-lived, Tochi and Brynner remained friends until his death in 1985. Concurrent with the series, Tochi was cast with fellow actor Luke in his first animated television series <i>The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan</i>; also in the series was a young Jodie Foster, who voiced his sister.</p><span>1990</span><p>As a voice actor, Tochi has provided voices for numerous animated films, computer games and animated cartoon series, including the <i>Bionic Six</i> (all 65 episodes), <i>Challenge of the GoBots</i>, <i>Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo</i>, <i>What's New, Scooby-Doo?</i>, <i>The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest</i>, and <i>Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm</i> (as its main star Liu Kang). He performed the voice of Leonardo in the first three <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i> films in the early 1990s. He also is the voice of the <a href=#>Chinese</a> soldier who runs the Great Wall in Disney's <i>Mulan</i>, and more recently had recurring roles in <i>Batman Beyond</i>, <i>As Told by Ginger</i>, <i>Kim Possible</i>, <i>Johnny Bravo</i>, <i>Static Shock</i>, <i>Family Guy</i> and <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i> on Nickelodeon.</p><span>2004</span><p>In 2004, Tochi co-wrote, produced and directed <i>Tales of a Fly on the Wall</i>, a scripted, live-action comedy, casting several of his friends in lead roles; it included fellow actors Roscoe Lee Browne, his <i>Revenge of the Nerds</i> co-star Curtis Armstrong and his <i>Police Academy 3: Back in Training</i> co-star Leslie Easterbrook. In 2005, he was one of the winners of the Hollywood Film Festival's Hollywood Screenplay Awards, taking home top honors for co-writing the screenplay "In the Heat of the Light". He continues with his directing, producing, and screenwriting careers.</p><span>2018</span><p>Tochi was born in Los Angeles, <a href=#>California</a>. He is the son of Joe Isao Tochihara (A.K.A. â€˜Tochiâ€™), a Beverly Hills <a href=#>Celebrity</a> hair salon owner, and Jane Yaeko (nÃ©e Harada), both <a href=#>Japanese</a>, and both of whom were forcibly interned during World War II. While Tochi was still young, the family moved from Los Angeles to Orange County, <a href=#>California</a>, where he divided his education between local public schools and studio tutors (for child actors) on movie studio lots. After graduation from high school, Tochi also attended U.S.C., UCLA, and U.C.I.</p><span>2019</span><p>Tochiâ€™s introduction into the entertainment industry came as a toddler. His fatherâ€™s beauty salon, Tochi Coiffure of Beverly Hills, was a popular haunt for many famous clients, including Lana Turner, Hedy Lamarr, Lucille Ball, Judy Garland, Petula Clark and Patty Duke. One of his fatherâ€™s customers, a top child agent, spotted the young Tochi running around the salon, and quickly signed to represent him.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.idolnetworth.com/images/play_game.png alt="More or less Game" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <a href=# class=btn>Play Game</a><h2>Tags:</h2><a href=#>1959 births</a> <a href=#>Living people</a> <a href=#>American male child actors</a> <a href=#>American male film actors</a> <a href=#>American film producers</a> <a href=#>American male screenwriters</a> <a href=#>American male television actors</a> <a href=#>American television journalists</a> <a href=#>American male voice actors</a> <a href=#>Male actors from Los Angeles</a> <a href=#>American people of Japanese descent</a> <a href=#>American male actors of Japanese descent</a> <a href=#>American male journalists</a> <a href=#>American journalists of Japanese descent</a> <a href=#>American film directors of Japanese descent</a> <a href=#>Film directors from California</a> <a href=#>Screenwriters from California</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeSp7aiuoytppygmWK7psCMsKarrJhihHWAmGw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbrian-tochi-net-worth-74493.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbrian-tochi-net-worth-74493.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbrian-tochi-net-worth-74493.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbrian-tochi-net-worth-74493.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbrian-tochi-net-worth-74493.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbrian-tochi-net-worth-74493.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./brownstone-spring-summer-2021-collection.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./brownstone-spring-summer-2021-collection.html>Brownstone Spring/Summer 2021 Collection Lookbook</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./bonnie-franklin-net-worth-131031.html>Bonnie Franklin Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./bonnie-franklin-net-worth-131031.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
