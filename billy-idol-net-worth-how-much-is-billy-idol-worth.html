Idol is half Irish; his mother is an O’Sullivan who was born in Cork.</p><p>When he was two years old, he and his parents immigrated to the United States and resided in Patchogue, New York. Additionally, they resided in Rockville Centre, New York. Jane, his younger sister, was conceived during this time.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading><a href=#>READ ALSO: Billy Idol Parents: Meet Joan And Bill Broad</a></h4><p>Four years later, the family moved back to England and lived in Dorking, Surrey. Idol attended Ravensbourne School for Boys in Bromley, southeast London, after the family relocated there in 1971.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/24210221/image-614.png><p>Later, his family relocated to West Sussex’s Goring-by-Sea, a Worthing suburb, where he attended Worthing High School for Boys.</p><p>He enrolled at the University of Sussex in October 1975 with the intention of studying English, but he left after the first year in 1976.</p><p>Then, he joined the loosely coordinated Bromley Contingent of Sex Pistols fans, who went to see the band everywhere they performed.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Billy Idol career</h2><p>Idol is a British musician, songwriter, and actor who holds dual citizenship as he is also identified as an American.</p><p>As the lead singer of the band Generation X, he originally rose to stardom in the 1970s after emerging from the London punk rock scene.</p><p>He then started a solo career that brought him notoriety on a global scale and helped make American Idol the lead performer during the MTV-driven “Second British Invasion” in the US. After hearing him described as “idle” by a teacher, he was given the appellation “Billy Idol”.</p><p>Idol made his musical debut in the punk rock band Chelsea in late 1976. He quickly, though, quit the gang. Idol co-founded Generation X with Tony James, a former bandmate.</p><p>The band, which included Idol as its lead singer, enjoyed success in the UK, put out three studio albums via Chrysalis Records, and then split up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/24210210/image-613-1024x576.png><p>Idol relocated to New York City in 1981 to work on his solo career with guitarist Steve Stevens.</p><p>Billy Idol, his first studio album, was a huge hit when it came out in 1982. Idol quickly established themselves as a mainstay of the then-newly created MTV with music videos for the tracks “Dancing with Myself” and “White Wedding”.</p><p>The 1983 smash singles “Rebel Yell” and “Eyes Without a Face” were featured on Idol’s second studio album, Rebel Yell, which was a huge commercial success.</p><p>The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) awarded the album double platinum status for its two million US copy shipping. He issued Whiplash Smile in 1986.</p><p>Idol issued a greatest hits album in 1988 titled Idol Songs: 11 of the Best, which went platinum in the UK after collecting three UK top 10 singles (“Rebel Yell,” “White Wedding,” and “Mony Mony”). The concept album Cyberpunk (1993) and Charmed Life (1990) were next published by Idol.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How much is Billy Idol worth?</h2><p>Billy Idol has a net worth estimated to be about $60 million.</p><p><strong>Source:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">www.Ghgossip.com</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jpugpaSpYralu8tmpZ6sXay8s8DHZp%2Bor12iwqS0jKKqZpqZobm6ecidpqVlp6S%2FtbSO</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbilly-idol-net-worth-how-much-is-billy-idol-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbilly-idol-net-worth-how-much-is-billy-idol-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbilly-idol-net-worth-how-much-is-billy-idol-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbilly-idol-net-worth-how-much-is-billy-idol-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbilly-idol-net-worth-how-much-is-billy-idol-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbilly-idol-net-worth-how-much-is-billy-idol-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./beyonce-daughter-blue-ivy-hopes-for-future-concert-famous-mom-revealed.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./beyonce-daughter-blue-ivy-hopes-for-future-concert-famous-mom-revealed.html>Blue Ivy Carter wants to perform again with mom Beyonc - and it involves more famous family member</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./berry-superfood-smoothie-bowl.html>Berry Superfood Smoothie Bowl</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./berry-superfood-smoothie-bowl.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
