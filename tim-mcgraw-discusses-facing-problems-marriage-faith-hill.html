"And sometimes I go, 'Dang, do we want them to be that independent and strong?' But yeah, we're so proud of them."&nbsp;</p><p id=eTMDL3nBQjD data-wc=53>Tim and Faith didn't opt for a<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;conventional showbiz wedding</a>. Instead, they invited friends and family members to Tim's aunt's house in Rayville, LA, under the ruse that they would play in a charity softball game, so they were more than surprised when the couple emerged from a tour bus wearing wedding attire.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/45ba716f44e7-tim-mcgraw-faith-hill-children.jpg><p id=eQqLZ5UpEie data-wc=72><strong>"We got off the bus and all my family was there and they were prepared to play softball and we get out in wedding clothes and got married under a locust tree in my aunt's backyard,"</strong> he explained on <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">LIVE! with Regis and Kelly</a> in 2011. When he was asked if his guests were angry about the surprise, Tim responded: "My sisters were a little upset because they wanted to dress up."&nbsp;</p><p id=eYEjsqfj9YX data-wc=40>Their engagement was equally unconventional but very memorable. On their 25th wedding anniversary, Tim opened up about how he popped the question in a trailer at a country music festival – but he had an agonizing wait for Faith's response.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0e387f75322e-tim-mcgraw-and-faith-hill.jpg><p id=e9E4mM2r_2 data-wc=59>"We had dated for a while. I actually asked her to marry me quite a few times, but she kept saying no. She said, 'I'm not gonna get involved with another country singer. It's just not gonna work out," he recalled. "We were somewhere playing this big outdoor festival and they had these trailer houses set up," Tim continued.&nbsp;</p><p id=eAtexaBuEh data-wc=88>"I'm getting ready to go on stage and I had this sort of case that had this big mirror in it. "She's standing there and we're talking, and I said, 'Look, let's get married.' And she says, 'You're asking me to marry you at a country music festival in a trailer house?' And I said, 'Well, it's pretty apropos if you think about it.' She goes, 'Are you serious?' I said, 'Well, yeah, I'm serious' – and then they called me and I had to go to stage."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/45ad1f7178b7-tim-mcgraw-and-faith-hill.jpg><p id=eQ_bp100lE data-wc=62>He added: "I went to stage and did the show and then I came off the stage and went back into my dressing room and Faith wasn't there. But I looked at the mirror – in lipstick it said, 'Yes. I'm gonna be your wife.' We still have that mirror, and it was the best day of my life, that's for sure."</p><p id=eK2C-g8GdzU data-wc=31></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfl7%2BqsMSsZm5oYGmCc3vToqRmpZOcv6LDjJ2grJulqMCmv4yfmJyhnpx6sb7Om6OepaNiuqK%2B0aKYoJ1dm66qwMdmn6KknGQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftim-mcgraw-discusses-facing-problems-marriage-faith-hill.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftim-mcgraw-discusses-facing-problems-marriage-faith-hill.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftim-mcgraw-discusses-facing-problems-marriage-faith-hill.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftim-mcgraw-discusses-facing-problems-marriage-faith-hill.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftim-mcgraw-discusses-facing-problems-marriage-faith-hill.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftim-mcgraw-discusses-facing-problems-marriage-faith-hill.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./toddy-smith-net-worth-189155.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./toddy-smith-net-worth-189155.html>Toddy Smith Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-real-reason-pauley-perrette-will-never-go-back-to-ncis.html>The Real Reason Pauley Perrette Will Never Go Back To NCIS</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-real-reason-pauley-perrette-will-never-go-back-to-ncis.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
