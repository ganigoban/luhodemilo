The 73-year-old is currently 17th in line to the throne, although this is mainly down to male-orientated primogeniture rules that meant when Prince Andrew and Prince Edward were born, Anne moved behind them and their children in the order of succession.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="What King Charles' cancer diagnosis means for other senior royals" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/d066d74870cb-gettyimages-1452320526.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="What King Charles' cancer diagnosis means for other senior royals" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>What King Charles' cancer diagnosis means for other senior royals</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eTzZxUkGkQu data-wc=33>Anne has had <a class=hm-link href=#>an incredibly interesting life</a>, with the royal previously dating Andrew Parker-Bowles, the ex-husband of Queen Camilla, was nearly kidnapped back in 1974 and has had two marriages and two children.</p><p id=eJVIDFUQHxE data-wc=53>In 1968, Anne met Mark Phillips, a lieutenant in the 1st Queen's Dragoon Guards, and the pair would go on to get engaged in 1973. Together, they would welcome two children, <a class=hm-link href=#>Peter</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>Zara</a>, however, things would not last for the couple with the pair separating in 1989 before finally divorcing in 1992.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6620e74818c6-princess-anne-prince-charles-malta.jpg><p id=ecmxXq1jPZT data-wc=48>Months after their divorce, Anne walked down the aisle again with Sir Timothy Laurence, who was a commander in the Royal Navy at the time. Anne became the first British royal to remarry since Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, a granddaughter of Queen Victoria, in 1905.</p><p id=e4Cdm7HapVr data-wc=33>Alongside her two children, Anne is also a doting grandmother. Her son Peter has welcomed daughters Savannah, 13, and Isla, 11. Meanwhile, her daughter Zara welcomed Mia, ten, Lena, five, and Lucas, two.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a4e0cb8728dc-gettyimages-1422575601.jpg><p id=eG78j3ovxHJ data-wc=44>Anne lives with Sir Timothy in Gatcombe Park, a country house in Gloucestershire, with Zara also owning a cottage on the property where she lives with husband Mike and their three children. The home has been the base of operations for Anne since 1976.</p><p id=eFPr9XahvkT data-wc=55>Anne and Charles have a famously strong relationship, with the Princess Royal essentially being one of the King's right-hand women. Anne has described herself as the <a class=hm-link href=#>"eyes and ears" of the monarchy</a> during an outing and she took on a special honour at the King's coronation, being in charge of his security as his Gold-Stick-in-Waiting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8bdb64eda7e6-king-charles-princess-anne-laughing.jpg><p id=eYCOuzjJw1xw data-wc=38>The royal brother and sister have been seen on many <a class=hm-link href=#>occasions giggling together</a>, whether they be at events hosted at Buckingham Palace, their traditional outing to the Braemar Games or even during the late Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations.</p><h2>Prince Andrew</h2><p id=e-_RvJkSJsPn data-wc=51>Andrew is 12 years younger than his older brother, and is currently eighth in line to the throne, but the Duke of York has been in a storm of sexual allegations over the past few years due to his friendship with the late Jeffrey Epstein, who was convicted of sexual trafficking.</p><p id=eOyk6ENUotjz data-wc=66>The allegations have seen Andrew retreat out of public life, with his late mother stripping him of some of his royal titles, while charities that used to be linked to the Duke have removed their support from him. The scandal also appears to impacted Andrew's relationship with his brother, with the King having reportedly been keen to keep his younger brother out of the public sphere.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d2f8ed27829c-king-charles-prince-andrew-baby.jpg><p id=eM-Q8IaYgkOm data-wc=39>However, things <a class=hm-link href=#>have appeared to mellow on that front</a>, with Andrew previously seen with the Prince and Princess of Wales in a car ride to church, and he joined his family at the annual Christmas Day outing to Sandringham.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e91c8fcde75b-king-charles-prince-andrew-bill-gates.jpg><p id=e8-oMceR5_b6 data-wc=65>In 1986, Andrew walked down the aisle with <a class=hm-link href=#>Sarah Ferguson</a>, with the pair going on to welcome two daughters, <a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Beatrice</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Eugenie</a>. However, Andrew and Sarah's relationship broke down, with the pair divorcing in 1996. However, Andrew has <a class=hm-link href=#>kept a close bond with his ex-wife</a> with the pair currently living together in the Royal Lodge, where they look after the late Queen's corgis.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cd2e875f91be-prince-andrew-daughters.jpg><p id=eeqDCvjoRi3t data-wc=29>Andrew and Sarah are also grandparents with Beatrice being a mum to daughter Sienna, two, while Eugenie has welcomed sons August, two, and Ernest, who is eight months old.</p><h2>Prince Edward</h2><p id=exbdi3fLtePI data-wc=33>Prince Edward is the King's youngest brother and was born on 10 March 1964. Edward has enjoyed a relatively low profile, however, the royal still takes on many roles within the royal family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a33555f94d5a-king-charles-prince-edward-go-karts.jpg><p id=eKFs8ENc3hmf data-wc=56>Edward, who is 14th in line to the throne, found love with <a class=hm-link href=#>Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh</a>, with the pair walking down the aisle on 19 June 1999. The lovebirds have welcomed two children, <a class=hm-link href=#>Lady Louise Windsor</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>James, Earl of Wessex</a>, and the pair have managed to keep their teen children mostly out of the spotlight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2f54bb523d23-prince-edward-children.jpg><p id=emk3AgiyYg7L data-wc=91>Edward and the monarch have had a fraught relationship over the years. The pair were close in their childhood, with sweet photos seeing the then-teenaged Prince playing around with his younger brother, but there have also been times of hardship. In 2001, Edward's former production company allegedly invaded the privacy of Prince William while he was studying, a move which angered Charles. However, the brothers have put their feud behind them, with Edward supporting his older brother during his coronation, with <a class=hm-link href=#>a sweet unseen moment</a> being aired in a BBC documentary.</p><p><b><i>LISTEN: Inside recent royal health stories</i></b></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
