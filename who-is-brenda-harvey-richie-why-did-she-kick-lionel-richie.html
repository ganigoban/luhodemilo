She was born to Lucille and Marshal Harvey. As per sources, Lucille was an English and Social Science teacher, Marshal was a US Marine and served in World War II. Stephen Harvey, Brenda Harvey-Richie’s only sibling, is frequently confused with American comedian and TV host Steve Harvey.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Brenda-Harvey-Richie-1.webp alt="Who Is Brenda Harvey-Richie?

Brenda was a passionate cheerleader in school, offering her heart to support her school’s athletic activities often. She enrolled in Tuskegee University in order to further her education, and in 1974, she received a BA in Social Work.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Career_Of_Brenda_Harvey-Richie></span><b>Career Of</b> <b>Brenda Harvey-Richie</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Brenda has always loved music, so she made the decision to try her hand at songwriting in an effort to make a living in the field. When she helped write songs for her ex-husband’s son, her skill at crafting enthralling melodies and moving lyrics became clear. She is well known for the 1984 single “Penny Lover,” which is a prominent example of her work.</span></p><p><span>Brenda Harvey-Richie established her own company, Brenda Richie Publishing. Through this venture, she played a crucial role in bringing hit songs like “All Night Long,” “Hello,” “Say You, Say Me,” and “Dancing On The Ceiling” to life, leaving an indelible mark on the music industry.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Brenda_Harvey-Richies_Relationship_With_Lionel_Richie></span><b>Brenda Harvey-Richie’s Relationship With Lionel Richie</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Brenda and <a href=#>Lionel</a> had been college sweethearts and got married in 1975, and they were married for 18 years. Lionel, Brenda Harvey’s ex-husband is a renowned American singer, songwriter, record producer, and television personality. He first rose to stardom in the 1970s as a songwriter and the co-lead singer of the Motown group Commodores.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Nicole Camille Escovedo, their only child, was adopted by them when she was just two years old. Nicole’s biological parents, Peter Escovedo and Karen Moss, were struggling financially, and it did not help that their marriage was falling apart as well. But as the years went by, their marriage ran into problems, and regrettably, they got divorced in 1993.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Divorce_Of_Brenda_And_Lionel_And_Why_She_Kicked_Him></span><b>Divorce Of Brenda And Lionel And Why She Kicked Him?</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Brenda accused her ex-husband of domestic violence during the turbulent times that followed their divorce. While still married to Brenda, Lionel was having an affair with a dancer named Diane Alexander, whom he met at the 1984 Olympics. She later hired a private investigator to carefully find out about his extramarital affairs. In 1988, Brenda unexpectedly showed up at Diane’s Beverly Hills home at 2 in the morning and found Lionel and Diane together.</span></p><p><span>According to Richie, who gave details to the police, Brenda kicked Richie in the stomach, turned over furniture, broke glasses, and caused a ruckus. When the police arrived, the situation was so terrible that Brenda had to be restrained on the ground while yelling for Diane.</span></p><p><span>Charges against Harvey included violence, trespassing, vandalism, causing bodily harm to her spouse, and resisting arrest. Brenda was released the following day after posting a $5,000 bond. After that contentious incident between him, Brenda, and his mistress, Lionel filed for divorce that same year, in 1988. Five years later, in 1993, the divorce was legally finalised.</span></p><p><span>After the divorce, her ex-husband married Diana Alexander Richie on 12 December 1995. They have a daughter named Sofia and a son named Miles. Harvey and Diana divorced in 2003.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Brenda_Harvey_%E2%80%93_Richie_Net_Worth></span><b>Brenda Harvey – Richie</b> <b>Net Worth</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Brenda was successful in transforming Brenda Richie Publishing into a flourishing firm via her commitment and commercial savvy.
