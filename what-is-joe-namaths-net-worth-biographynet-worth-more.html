Once on The James Brown Show, Namath revealed that he was the only white player on his high school basketball team. He also made dunks in an era when it was rarely seen in high school basketball.</p><p>Cartilage damage to Namath’s knee made him ineligible for the draft during the Vietnam war, and he was signed by the New York Jets (who then played in the AFL). In 1965, he was given the nickname “Broadway Joe” after appearing on the cover of “Sports Illustrated.” During his first season, Namath was named AFL Rookie of the Year. Despite this, he continued to struggle with knee injuries.</p><p>Shortly before the NFL and the AFL were merged into one, Joe Namath played the game of his life during Super Bowl III, beating the Baltimore Colts after personally guaranteeing the victory days earlier. He became the MVP of the Superbowl game, completing eight passes to one player alone (George Sauer) for 133 yards.</p><p>Over the next period, Namath struggled with injuries and began to miss games for the first time in his career. However, Joe continued to wow audiences, throwing for 496 yards in a victory against the Colts.</p><p>Many experts consider this to be the finest example of passing in a single game. Towards the end of his career, he transferred to the Los Angeles Rams. Numerous injuries prevented him from finishing on a high, and he retired at the end of the 1977 season.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How many houses and cars does Joe Namath have?</h2><p>Joe Namath has several houses in the United States as well as owning several cars.
