This helps to keep the cookies from spreading too much and keeping their shape while baking.</li><li><strong>Brown Sugar</strong> — this is light golden brown sugar and helps to create the chewy centers.</li><li><strong>Sugar</strong> — this helps to give the perfectly crispy exterior Levain Bakery is known for.</li><li><strong>Eggs</strong> — use large eggs in this cookie recipe.</li><li><strong>Vanilla Extract</strong> (optional) — Levain Bakery is known for not using vanilla extract in its recipes. It adds flavor so add it if you would like to!</li><li><strong>Flour</strong> — I suggest using both all-purpose flour and cake flour. Cake flour has less gluten in it which helps to create a tender, soft texture. You can use only all-purpose flour in this recipe and the cookies still turn out delicious!</li><li><strong>Cornstarch</strong> — this is a game-changing ingredient as it helps to create a thick and gooey center, without making the cookies cakey.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Baking Soda</strong> — this is what helps the cookies to rise once they hit the oven.</li><li><strong>Salt</strong> — a flavor enhancer and an integral ingredient in baking.</li><li><strong>Chocolate Chips</strong> — I suggest using semi-sweet chocolate chips or a mix of dark and semi-sweet chocolate chips. Levain Bakery uses both types of chocolate.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Levain-Bakery-Two-Chip-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies-4-edit-720x564.jpg alt="Levain Bakery Two Chip Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe is their classic chocolate chip cookie made without nuts.

There is a reason why there is a line out the door at every single bakery! There are certain ingredients and techniques that make these cookies different —&nbsp; the use of cold butter, no vanilla extract, using two types of flour, the addition of cornstarch, their large 6-ounce size, and baking at a high temperature.&nbsp;</p><p>This isn’t your average chocolate chip cookie recipe! No chilling required chocolate chip cookie recipe.</p><h2>Tips for making Levain Bakery Chocolate Chip Cookies:</h2><li><strong>Start by cutting the butter into small cubes</strong> to make the butter easier to cream with the sugar and brown sugar. Creaming the butter and sugars together is an important step to create a smooth texture and to whip air into the cookie dough, which helps to give the cookies loft.</li><li><strong>Don’t overmix the dry ingredients</strong>. If you overmix the cookie dough once you add the flour, it can create too much gluten and will result in a tough cookie.</li><li><strong>Bake just until a light golden brown color</strong> on a light-colored baking sheet. Make sure to not overbake these cookies or they may end up brown on the bottom. To avoid that, read my tips below.</li><li><strong>Let set up for at least 10-15 minutes</strong>. This is an important step as these are gooey cookies and need time to set up before eating them.</li><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Levain-Bakery-Two-Chip-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies-6-720x559.jpg alt="Levain Bakery Two Chip Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe is their classic chocolate chip cookie made without nuts.

The rule of thumb in baking is that it is better to underbake and cookie rather than overbake a cookie.
