The couple divorced around 2008 after which Hilary moved to Toronto to audition for the HGTV show.</span></p><p><span>Since she’s been in the limelight, Hilary has rarely spoken about her former husband, so not much is known about him or what might have led to their divorce.&nbsp;According to Gordon Farr’s IMDB page, he’s an Emmy-nominated screenwriter and television producer and it’s likely they could have met while Hilary was in Hollywood.&nbsp;Gordon Farr credits include Keeping Up with the Jones, Hollywood Babylon and more.&nbsp;Their marriage had a son.</span></p><p><span>Hilary has often expressed her fondness for her son whom she says as the rest of her family calls him MM, which translates to Mighty Mumster.&nbsp;She also said her proudest moment of her life was all her son had ever done.</span></p><p><span>Due to the undeniable chemistry Farr shares with his co-host David Visentin, many have been falsely led to believe that they are a couple.&nbsp;However, they are not.&nbsp;David Visentin has been married to a certain Krista Visentin since 2006.</span></p><p><span>If something was wrong with this union, rumors would surely blame him for his fondness for Hilary Farr.&nbsp;They have a lot in common.&nbsp;both have a history of acting and a lot more.</span></p><p><span>Hilary Farr has an estimated net worth of $7 million.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Body Stats</span></strong></h2><p><strong><span>Height:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;5 feet 9 inches</span></p><p><strong><span>Eye color:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Dark brown</span></p><p><strong><span>Hair color:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;brown</span></p><p><strong><span>Body measurements:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;35-25-36 inches</span></p><p><strong><span>Dress size:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;6 (US)</span></p><p><strong><span>Weight:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;58 kg (estimated)</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGigmaGus8WMn5irql2XvKXFjKyrmqyjYq6osYyspqdlnZa%2Fs7XEnWShraOXrq%2BwjJ%2BYpqGcrnqpscign61n</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhilary-farr-body-stats-age-son-married-husband-family-height.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhilary-farr-body-stats-age-son-married-husband-family-height.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhilary-farr-body-stats-age-son-married-husband-family-height.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhilary-farr-body-stats-age-son-married-husband-family-height.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhilary-farr-body-stats-age-son-married-husband-family-height.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhilary-farr-body-stats-age-son-married-husband-family-height.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-marc-anthony-famous-friendship-proved-challenging-jennifer-lopez-details-revealed-documentary.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-marc-anthony-famous-friendship-proved-challenging-jennifer-lopez-details-revealed-documentary.html>How Marc Anthony's famous 'friendship' proved challenging for JLo - details revealed in documentary</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jim-carrey-grinch-2-html.html>Grinch 2 Happening With Jim Carrey?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jim-carrey-grinch-2-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
