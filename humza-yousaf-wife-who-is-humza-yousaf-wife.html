That same year (2018), he was appointed to the Scottish Cabinet as Cabinet Secretary for Justice in Nicola Sturgeon’s 2018 cabinet reshuffle.</p><p>Yousaf then became the first non-white cabinet minister in the Scottish Government. In 2021, he worked as Health Secretary and since has been leading the Scottish Government’s COVID-19 vaccination program.</p><p>As a member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), Yousaf has been a Member of the Scottish Parliament for Glasgow Pollok since 2016 and previously represented the Glasgow region from 2011 to 2016.</p><p>In February 2023, Yousaf made headlines when he declared his candidacy for Yousaf leadership and First Minister of Scotland after Nicola Sturgeon announced her resignation.</p><p>Nicola Ferguson Sturgeon happens to be a Scottish politician who served as First Minister of Scotland and Leader of the Scottish National Party since 2014.</p><p>On Wednesday, February 15, 2023, she (Nicola Sturgeon) announced that she would resign as first minister and Scottish National Party leader once a new leader is elected.</p><p>Following Nicola Sturgeon’s announcement to resign, Humza Yousaf as well as former minister, Ash Regan, and finance minister, Kate Forbes officially announced bids to occupy her position.</p><p>However, Humza Yousaf has emerged as the frontrunner to replace Sturgeon pledging to uphold Nicola Sturgeon’s socially progressive policy agenda.</p><p>On Monday, February 20, Yousaf said that he backs Sturgeon’s stances on same-sex marriage, abortion clinic buffer zones, banning conversion practices, and gender recognition changes.</p><p>He added that he would “absolutely” challenge the UK government’s block on Holyrood’s gender recognition bill.</p><p>Humza Yousaf said the UK government’s decision to block the bill, which recent polls suggest is supported by a majority of Scottish voters, was in reality “an assault, an attack” on Holyrood’s autonomy.</p><p>The leadership of the Scottish National Party has said it will choose a new leader within six weeks through a ballot of its members, which will close on March 27.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Humza Yousaf Wife: Who Is Humza Yousaf Wife?</h2><p>We are not very sure as to whether or not Humza Yousaf is married.
