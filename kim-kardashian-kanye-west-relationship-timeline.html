Though the days of over-the-top music video cameos, front-row fashion show appearances, and jaw-dropping cover interviews may ultimately be over, we'll always have the memories—and, oh, are there many.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Take a look back at Kim and Kanye's relationship over the years below.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">2003: Kim and Kanye meet through mutual friend Brandy.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I met him I think in 2002 or 2003.
