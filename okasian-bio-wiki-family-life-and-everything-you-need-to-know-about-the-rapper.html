<time>23 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><span>One of the best Korean rappers, Okasian(used), is expanding his horizons at a very fast pace.&nbsp;People are getting more and more moved by the star’s incredible contribution to the entertainment industry.&nbsp;The Korean-American rapper and singer stormed into limelight in 2012 with his debut album&nbsp;</span><span>Boarding Procedures</span><span>&nbsp;and has been working hard to stay relevant ever since.&nbsp;Considering his musical exploits, it’s only fair to give hip-hop fans the chance to find out more about him.&nbsp;Below are interesting facts about this talented personality.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Okasian Biography,</span></strong></h2><p><span>He was born on March 11, 1987. Always musically inclined, Okasian would become the top rapper among his peers in high school and would gradually find himself reaching great heights in this genre of music.&nbsp;He then enrolled in college and studied biology.&nbsp;In middle school, Okasian started writing his own lyrics and recording songs.&nbsp;After graduation, the rapper sought a career in music.&nbsp;He returned to Korea to pursue that dream and began a career that had many good days.</span></p><p><span>Okasian belongs to the cohort crew consisting of Keith Ape, JayAllDay, Kangkook, Oscar Lee, B-Free, Bryan Chase, Coke Jazz and AM.KAY.&nbsp;The cohort was formed after Okasian’s invitation by Kangkook and a friend of his from New York.&nbsp;JayAllDay and a few others also joined the crew which gradually became a major group in Asia.&nbsp;The formation of the group worked wonderfully, especially since everyone was passionate about the same style of music.&nbsp;Like Okasian, some members of the music group make music, while others are given other responsibilities.</span></p><p><span>The rapper first signed with Hi-Lite Records;&nbsp;this was after making two mixtapes with The Cohort –&nbsp;</span><span>Pre-Season #1</span><span>&nbsp;released in 2010, and&nbsp;</span><span>Pre-Season #2</span><span>&nbsp;released in 2011. In 2016 he left the label choosing to become an independent artist.&nbsp;Okasian then signed under The Black Label.</span></p><p><span>With the help of CB Mass, Okasian came up with his first Korean album.&nbsp;He also had the help of American rapper Nas who helped produce his first American album.&nbsp;Okasian is popularly known for his hit single,&nbsp;</span><span>This is G Ma</span><span>&nbsp;Keith Ape from the cohort.&nbsp;The Korean rapper described as the star of the group would have discovered Keith Ape when he was a teenager.&nbsp;The song featured JayAllDay, Loota, Okasian and other crew members.</span></p><p><span>The track is said to have embraced the true concept of Korean style, unlike most Korean rap songs which tend to derive more insight from American music.&nbsp;The success of It G Ma also opened up the rapper to more collaborations.&nbsp;The top Korean rapper is known for his unique flows that he releases effortlessly while maintaining a steady balance and tempo.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Family life</span></strong></h2><p><span>Okasian, real name Kim Ji-Yong was born to her parents in the United States.&nbsp;His stage name, Okasian, is a combination of Ok and Asian that sounds like “occasion” when pronounced.&nbsp;The South Korean rapper is also called Alexander Kim – his English name.&nbsp;When he was very small, Okasian was taken to Korea.&nbsp;he returned to America when he was old enough for high school – at the age of sixteen.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Other things to know about the rapper</span></strong></h2><p><span>1. Little is known about the personal life of this talented rapper.&nbsp;Okasian reportedly had a relationship with Soo Yeon in 2015. It has not been verified if the two are still together.</span></p><p><span>2. It G Ma has garnered over 60 million views over the years, casting Khiphop all over the world.</span></p><p><span>3 Like most of his counterparts, Okasian has been embroiled in several feuds with other celebrities in the industry.&nbsp;He got into a fight with Dok2 after he undermined the efforts in It G Ma. At the time, Alexander Kim took to Instagram to applaud Dok2, calling him a “f**kboy.”</span></p><p><span>4. Okasian will hardly go unnoticed with his body covered in tattoos.&nbsp;The rapper’s arms are well covered in tattoos which always set him apart from the rest of the crew.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGinm5bAqq3NZpmip12stqy1jJ%2BYpqGcrnqttcWeZJqmlGKyt7HRsquhoZ6cerq71Galnp2UYsGwecqnprBlkZe8tsCMrZ%2BeZaKWvbGx0Wg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fokasian-bio-wiki-family-life-and-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-rapper.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fokasian-bio-wiki-family-life-and-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-rapper.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fokasian-bio-wiki-family-life-and-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-rapper.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fokasian-bio-wiki-family-life-and-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-rapper.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fokasian-bio-wiki-family-life-and-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-rapper.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fokasian-bio-wiki-family-life-and-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-rapper.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./oscar-winner-olivia-colman-broadchurch-david-tennant.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./oscar-winner-olivia-colman-broadchurch-david-tennant.html>Oscar winner Olivia Colman enjoys Broadchurch reunion</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./nicole-franzel-net-worth-173691.html>Nicole Franzel Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./nicole-franzel-net-worth-173691.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
